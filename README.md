# LifeVenture
Social media app to share experiences and inspire adventure.

This app has been in idea stage for years, and is finally in a long process of becoming reality. 
The aim is a sort of 'blog meets strava meets instagram' platform for shared scrapbooking with searchable geo-data. 
Hoping to bring it live by the time two diffrent groups of my friends leave on 'round the world extended travels next year.

To run, please email me at dbruner23@gmail.com for .env keys for front and back ends. Then cd into 'server' and 'client' respectively and run 'npm install' and 'npm start'.
Then create your own account or login with my email and password 'testing.'
